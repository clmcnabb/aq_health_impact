# AQI Health Impacts

This is a small, fun side project that aims to look at different air quality metrics and their effects on health. The target variable is the HealthImpactClass, that categorizes the impact of the factors on health quality.

The dataset comes from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/air-quality-and-health-impact-dataset/data).
